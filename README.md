## This data belongs to Adidas in the United States.
## The goal of this project is to show:
    Revenues
    Operating profit
    Operating margin
    Number of Units sold
    Number of States that purchase Adidas products
    Revenue, Operating Profit and Units Sold by Year, Quarter and Month
    Revenue, Operating Profit and Units Sold by Region, State and City
    Revenue, Operating Profit and Units Sold by Retailer, Product and Sales Method

## The most important goal of this project:
      1) Is there a relationship between the number of Units Sold, Revenues, and Operating Profit?
            Yes, there is a strong relationship between the number of Units Sold, Revenues, and Operating 
            Profit. As the number of Units Sold increases, Revenues increase, so Operating Profit increases.

      2) Why did Adidas' revenues increase 4 times in 2021 over 2020?
          This is due to the increase in the number of units sold due to the increase in the number of 
          retailers for Adidas products, such as (Amazon), and the increase in online orders due to the Covid 
          pandemic, which made us sell our products in 46 states after we were selling in only 9 states.
